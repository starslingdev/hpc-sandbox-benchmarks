# Backfill the committed dataset from a previous Bench matrix run by dispatching commit-dataset.yml.
#
# When a matrix run's dataset commit fails (or was never reached), a codeowner re-runs the aggregate +
# promote + commit step standalone against that run's still-retained experiment plan and attempt artifacts — no
# re-benching. This is a thin wrapper over `gh workflow run` so the dispatch is one command instead of
# a hand-assembled API call; the same thing is doable from the Actions UI (Actions → Commit dataset →
# Run workflow). See docs/ci-secrets.md rule 6.
#
# Requires `gh` authenticated with rights to dispatch workflows on this repo. The dispatch is gated by
# Environment `privileged` (main-only + required reviewer), so it parks for maintainer approval — being
# a codeowner is necessary but the environment's reviewer still has to approve the run.
#
# Usage: scripts/backfill-dataset.sh <run-id> [--allow-partial]
#   <run-id>          The Bench matrix run id whose experiment plan and attempt artifacts to aggregate + commit.
#   --allow-partial   Publish an incomplete experiment as an explicitly partial Run (ADR-0012). Without
#                     it the workflow keeps strict completeness and refuses a run with failed cells.

# upstream copy so invoking this helper from a fork cannot report success for a run that immediately skips.

# Best-effort heads-up: backfill only works while the run's experiment plan and attempt artifacts are still inside the
# repo's retention window. A missing set isn't fatal here (the workflow fails loudly with the same
# diagnosis), but warning now saves a round-trip through the approval gate for a run whose shards expired.
# The lookup must stay non-fatal under `set -euo pipefail`: a transient gh error (5xx, 404 on a bad run
# id, missing artifact-read scope) makes the pipeline exit non-zero via pipefail, which would otherwise
# abort the script before dispatch. Guard the assignment with `if !` so a failed lookup only warns.

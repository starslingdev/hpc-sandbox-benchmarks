# Architecture Decision Records

Short records of the load-bearing decisions in this repo — the ones that shape what you can import,
how a measurement becomes a published number, and why the gates are where they are. Each ADR is
**Context / Decision / Consequences**: the problem, the choice, and what we accept by making it.

These describe *why the code is the way it is*; the [methodology](../methodology.md) describes *how a
measurement is produced* and [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) the local gate. When a decision
here changes, supersede the ADR (leave it in place, note what replaced it) rather than deleting it.

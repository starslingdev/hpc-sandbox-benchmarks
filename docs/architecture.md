# Architecture

How the repository itself is put together: the workspace, its enforced boundaries, the command
contract, and the gates that hold them. For how a *measurement* is produced, see
[methodology](./methodology.md).

## The repository

This repo is a **Bun workspace monorepo** with a strict, enforced dependency DAG and a uniform
package shape. The guiding rule: *"can I import this?"* is answered by the path alone, and
boundary violations fail CI.

## Source-first, no build step

Every package's `exports` map points at TypeScript **source** (`./src/index.ts`), and Bun resolves
workspace sources natively. There is no compile step: `bun install` → `typecheck` → `test` →
`lint` are all green with zero compilation. The committed `bun.lock` pins the whole graph.

## Layout

```text
packages/   importable libraries   — scope @sandbox-benchmarks/*
  schema/       shared types + arktype schemas, vendored PTS profiles + generated metric catalog (bottom of the DAG)
  providers/    provider adapters → schema + computesdk
  templates/    per-provider template builders + toolchain Docker images (images/)
  harness/      benchmark timing → providers + schema
  results/      normalization + the comparison surface → schema, figures
  figures/      realworld charts: Run → figure model → HTML → WebP (headless Chrome) → schema
apps/
  cli/          entrypoint with bin commands → every packages/* library
tooling/        dev-only            — scope @repo/*
  tsconfig/     shared source-first TS configs (config-only)
  test-utils/   provider conformance suite factory
  repo-checks/  boundary + package-meta invariant tests
lib/        in-sandbox benchmark runner (bench.sh), realworld PTS runner overlay, isolation probe
data/       committed benchmark dataset (published run results)
scripts/    maintainer scripts (dataset backfill, leaderboard update)
docs/       methodology, ADRs, CI & secrets
```

## Dependency DAG (enforced)

| Member                      | Internal deps (`workspace:*`)                   | External (catalog)                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/schema`     | —                                               | `arktype`                           |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/providers`  | schema                                          | `arktype`, computesdk packages (`catalog:computesdk`) |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/templates`  | providers, schema                               | `computesdk` (`catalog:computesdk`) |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/harness`    | providers, schema                               | —                                   |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/figures`    | schema                                          | `arktype`, fonts (`@fontsource/*`)  |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/results`    | schema, figures                                 | `arktype`, XML tooling (`catalog:xml`) |
| `@sandbox-benchmarks/cli` (app)  | schema, providers, templates, harness, results, figures | `dotenv`, `@actions/core`, provider SDKs (`catalog:computesdk`) |
| `@repo/tsconfig`            | —                                               | —                                   |
| `@repo/test-utils`          | schema                                          | —                                   |
| `@repo/repo-checks`         | —                                               | —                                   |

`results` depends on `schema` and `figures` alone — it must normalize without any provider SDK,
and it now also builds the leaderboard's chart documents. `@repo/repo-checks` enforces that no
package reaches across boundaries or into another package's private `lib/`.

`figures` is typed by `schema` — the workspace's one Run contract and registry shapes — so it
re-describes nothing the workspace already owns, but the registries still arrive as ARGUMENTS:
there is no module-level dataset, so its guards run against synthetic runs instead of whatever
the committed dataset contains. Its charts are pure string building (HTML with fonts inlined
from pinned packages), and `results` owns the seam that passes the real registries. The one
impure step — headless Chrome, via `Bun.WebView` — lives behind its own entry point,
`@sandbox-benchmarks/figures/screenshot`, imported only by the CLI: everything that merely reads
the Run model or builds a document never spawns a browser.

## Command contract

| Command              | What it does                                                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bun install`        | Resolve the graph, symlink workspaces, install catalogs (≥7-day-old releases). |
| `bun run typecheck`  | `tsc --noEmit` per member — proof of source-first/no-build.             |
| `bun run test`       | Browser-free `bun test` per member, including repo-checks invariants, excluding the Chrome-backed figures suite. |
| `bun run test:figures` | Chrome-backed figures screenshot tests; CI's `figures` job runs this on a hosted runner with pinned headless Chrome. |
| `bun run lint`       | `biome check . --error-on-warnings` — CI gate; warnings fail (root-only Biome config). |
| `bun run format`     | `biome format . --write` — formatting only (no import sorting / lint fixes). |
| `bun run lint:fix`   | `biome check . --write` — formatting + import sorting + safe lint fixes. |
| `bun run lint:fix:unsafe` | `biome check . --fix --unsafe` — also applies behavior-changing fixes; review the diff. |
| `bun run spell`      | `typos` — source-code spell check (run it before pushing).              |
| `bun run spell:fix`  | `typos --write-changes` — apply typos' suggested corrections.            |
| `bun run lint:shell` | `shellcheck` on the repo's shell scripts (toolchain images, `lib/`, mise tasks) and the `run:` blocks embedded in `.github/actions/` composite actions. |
| `bun run lint:docker`| `hadolint` on the toolchain-image Dockerfiles (`packages/templates/images`). |
| `bun run smoke`      | Boot each provider's sandbox from the baked image and smoke-test it (providers without credentials are skipped). |
| `bun run check:catalog-drift` | Fails if the generated PTS catalog drifted from the vendored profiles. |

Run a single bin during development: `bun apps/cli/src/bin/plan-matrix.ts`.

## Toolchain (mise)

Non-Bun tools are version-pinned in [`mise.toml`](../mise.toml) and managed with
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) (spell check),
`shellcheck` + `hadolint` (shell/Dockerfile lint for the toolchain images), and
`actionlint` + `zizmor` (workflow lint + security audit, run by the `ci-lint` workflow). After
cloning, run `mise install` (and `mise trust` once) so the pinned binaries are available; the
`bun run` wrappers invoke these tools through `mise exec`, so they always use the pinned versions.
mise fetches from official release sources with checksum verification — no npm republisher and no
install-time postinstall.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the command contract on every pull request and every push to
`main`: `bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts` → `bun run lint` (the Biome gate) →
`bun run lint:shell` → `bun run lint:docker` → `bun run typecheck` → browser-free `bun run test` →
`bun run check:catalog-drift` → `bun run spell` (typos, set up via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)).
A second `figures` job runs pinned-Chrome `bun run test:figures` on a hosted `ubuntu-24.04` runner —
the same image that renders the committed figures, and the one where Chrome can keep its sandbox.
A separate `ci-lint.yml` lints the workflows themselves (actionlint + zizmor). The browser-free
checks run locally; CI additionally exercises the Chrome-backed figures suite with its pinned browser.

CI runs on a maintainer-controlled runner, so it never executes fork-PR code — the gate runs only
for pushes and same-repo pull requests. Anything that needs provider credentials additionally runs
only from `main`, behind Environment [`privileged`](./ci-secrets.md); pull requests never
receive provider secrets.

## Git hooks (pre-commit)

[Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev) runs a fast local mirror of CI on every commit, configured in
`lefthook.yml`:

- **Biome** on staged files (`biome check --write`, restaging any auto-fixes; unfixable issues or
  warnings block the commit).
- **Typos** repo-wide (`bun run spell`) — read-only, so run `bun run spell:fix` to apply corrections.
- **Lockfile** check (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`) when a manifest or `bun.lock` is staged, so
  `package.json` and `bun.lock` can't drift apart.

`bun install` wires the hooks automatically via the project's own `prepare` script
(`lefthook install`) — no third-party postinstall runs. Re-install them with `bunx lefthook
install`, and bypass a single commit with `LEFTHOOK=0 git commit`.

## Supply-chain posture

`bunfig.toml` sets `minimumReleaseAge = 604800` (7 days) so freshly published — possibly
compromised — releases are not installed, and **no third-party lifecycle scripts run** (empty
`trustedDependencies`). The git hooks above are wired by the project's own first-party `prepare`
script, not a dependency's postinstall, and CI installs with `--ignore-scripts` so it runs none
either. Lint and formatting are root-only via a single `biome.json`.

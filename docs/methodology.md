# Methodology

How a number in this repo's dataset is produced, and the caveats that keep it comparable across
providers and over time.

## North star

Compare sandbox **providers**, not bare-metal hardware. Every provider is asked to run the same
workloads on the same pinned spec, and the results are normalized into one schema-validated dataset.

Where a vendor exposes more than one **isolation technology**, each is a first-class provider variant
so the comparison attributes results to the isolation the sandbox actually used: `daytona-vm` (a
`SandboxClass.LINUX_VM` microVM) vs `daytona-container` (a Sysbox/OCI container), and `modal-gvisor`
(Modal's default gVisor runtime) vs `modal-vm` (Modal's gVisor-free VM runtime). Each provider's
declared isolation is the authoritative label and is shown in the leaderboard's **Providers in this
run** roster, beside a best-effort **detected** class from an in-sandbox probe (gVisor kernel marker;
a cgroup quota far below the disclosed host ⇒ container; a self-sized hypervisor ⇒ VM). The probe
cannot separate every type — a container and a microVM can both report `kvm`; gVisor and a microVM can
both report `unknown` — so it is only a cross-check that flags a declared/detected contradiction, never
a source of truth.

## Target spec

Every provider is created at one pinned [`TARGET_SPEC`](../packages/schema/src/providers.ts): **4 vCPU,
8 GiB RAM, 40 GB disk**. 8 GiB RAM fits inside every provider's reproducible envelope (E2B caps sandbox
RAM at 8 GiB); vCPU is pinned at 4 because Blaxel couples CPU to RAM (8 GiB forces 4 vCPU there), so
targeting 4 lets every provider — Blaxel included — match on the same shape. A provider that can't express a dimension
runs with its actuals recorded and the mismatch disclosed (`specMatched`). Its measurements stay in the
rankings, but the leaderboard flags the provider with an explicit **Comparability warning** naming its
observed allocation, so its ranks are never read as like-for-like with the compute-matched providers.

## Dimensions and metrics

Results land on a closed, ordered set of [`DIMENSIONS`](../packages/schema/src/metrics.ts): `lifecycle`,
`control-plane`, `cpu`, `disk`, `memory`, `network`, `system`, `realworld`, `economics`. Each catalogued
[`MetricDef`](../packages/schema/src/metrics.ts) declares its `dimension`, `unit`, `direction` (HIB =
higher-is-better, LIB = lower-is-better), and whether it `headline`s its dimension. The leaderboard
shows exactly one headline metric per dimension (enforced at catalog load).

Metrics come from three sources:

- **PTS-derived** — generated from vendored Phoronix Test Suite profiles (see the
  [ADR-0003](./adr/0003-generated-pts-catalog-and-drift-gate.md)). The generator owns the
  XML-derived fields and id-uniqueness; a hand-authored override map supplies editorial fields.
  A `<Result>` maps onto the catalog by its versionless test + `<Description>`; profiles whose
  parsers post several scales under one description (fio: bandwidth + IOPS from a single run) get
  one metric per scale, disambiguated by a `pts.scale` pin the mapping also matches on.
- **Harness-measured** — lifecycle (spawn/exec/snapshot/teardown) and control-plane (info/list)
  timings PTS can't see, measured directly around the provider SDK calls.
- **Derived (economics)** — never measured; computed from pricing + measured runtime (below).

## Economics ($/run)

The `economics` dimension is the price/performance axis. It's `derived` — computed at normalization
from each provider's published, vetted pricing
([`hourlyCostAtTargetSpec`](../packages/schema/src/providers.ts)) plus the runtime already on the Run:

- `usd_per_hour` (headline) — hourly cost at the target spec; the comparison denominator.
- `usd_per_lifecycle` — hourly cost × the summed measured lifecycle timings; emitted only when a Run
  carries lifecycle metrics.

A provider with no vetted rate emits no economics (a null rate must never read as free). Economics
enriches a provider that already produced ≥1 measured metric — it never promotes a `pending` provider.

## Host vs. effective specs (the host-fingerprint caveat)

`ObservedSpecs` splits what a Run saw into two sides:

- **Effective** (`vcpus`/`memoryGb`/`diskGb`) — the sandbox's actual size (cgroup quota where enforced),
  from the in-sandbox spec probe.
- **Host** (`hostVcpus`/`hostMemoryGb`/`cpuModel`/…) — the underlying machine, parsed from the PTS
  composite's `<System>` block.

In a container `<System>` discloses the **host** (e.g. a 48-thread EPYC), not the 4-vCPU sandbox quota.
The normalizer therefore maps `<System>` only to the host side and merges it **under** the spec probe,
so a host disclosure can never masquerade as the sandbox's effective size. Forensic logs are captured as
a `*--forensics.tar.gz` tarball (a tarball, not loose files, so nested `.xml` can't be misrouted).

PTS `MONITOR`/sensor data is deliberately **not** collected: it's host-level (unattributable per
provider) and its empty-`<Identifier>` `<Result>` nodes would abort extraction — the producer unsets
`MONITOR`.

## Transport model

Providers differ in how their `@computesdk/*` adapter executes a command. Each declares a
[`ProviderTransport`](../packages/schema/src/providers.ts) capability (`streaming`, `syncCapMs`,
`detachedPoll`), and the harness selects a transport per step: a step that could outlast the provider's
synchronous cap runs **detached + poll** where supported, everything else runs directly. This is why a
multi-minute suite completes on a single-round-trip-capped provider (e.g. Daytona's server-side HTTP 408)
without being Daytona-specific.

## The dataset pipeline

1. **Run** — `bench-suite <provider> <suite> <runId> --replicate <idx>` boots a sandbox, runs the
   suite's mise tasks, pulls the raw tree (`data/raw/<runId>/<provider>/<suite>/`), and normalizes it
   into a Run document stamped with its replicate index.
2. **Matrix** — the `bench-matrix` workflow plans three axes (`plan-providers` / `plan-suites` /
   `plan-replicates`), then one suite-matrix job calls the reusable `bench-suite` workflow per suite
   (GitHub-native nesting: `<suite> / <provider> (replicate N)`), fanning out over the selected
   providers × that suite's replicate sandboxes; every `(provider, suite, replicate)` cell uploads its
   shard Run as an artifact. Two axes are the statistical knobs — **replicates** (R sandboxes per cell,
   the between-machine axis: `replicas` blank = each suite's `Suite.defaultReplicas`, or a number to
   override every suite) and **PTS passes** (the within-machine axis: `pts_passes` blank = each suite's
   fixed count, a number, or `converge` to let PTS's own statistical convergence decide). Both default
   to the per-suite schema config, so a bare dispatch reproduces the configured run.
3. **Aggregate → promote → commit** — the `commit-dataset` workflow (the matrix's `publish` job calls
   it) collects every shard, `aggregate`s them into one candidate Run (measured metrics unioned, the ≥2
   replicate sandboxes of one `(provider, suite)` folded into per-metric replicate breakdowns, economics
   re-derived from the merged set), then `promote`s it (gate: ≥1 validated provider) into the committed
   dataset at `data/dataset/` with a newest-first index, and opens a PR to land it on `main`. This step
   commits only the machine-readable dataset — it never touches `LEADERBOARD.md`.
4. **Leaderboard** — the `update-leaderboard` workflow renders a chosen committed Run into a ranked
   Markdown table per dimension (`leaderboard`) and opens a PR to update `LEADERBOARD.md`. It is a
   deliberate, maintainer-dispatched step (default: the newest committed run), so the dataset can grow a
   run per matrix run while the public comparison surface only moves when someone updates it. See
   [CI & secrets](./ci-secrets.md) rule 7.
5. **Stability gate** — `stability <prev> <cur>` flags any provider metric that shifted beyond the noise
   threshold across Runs, comparing only provenance-matched (same `appVersion` + `arguments`) metrics.

Every Run is validated against the schema at the producer boundary, so no malformed Run reaches a
consumer. The whole pipeline is reproducible: a committed `bun.lock`, vendored PTS profiles, and a
byte-stable catalog held by the drift gate.

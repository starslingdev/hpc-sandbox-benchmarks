// The driver composition root (ADR-0007 §1).
//
// The kit deliberately splits three trust boundaries that a single `config` object used to blur:
// loading a driver module reads no ambient env, resolving an artifact imports no vendor SDK, and the
// driver never decides whether a run boots a candidate or a published artifact. This module owns
// those three small functions and nothing else, so `apps/cli` stays the only place the fleet and the
// harness meet.
//
// It also owns the two adapters that let a `SandboxSession` drive today's harness while
// `packages/harness` still speaks the legacy `SandboxHandle` shape. Both are deliberately thin and
// both disappear when the harness flips to the port.
